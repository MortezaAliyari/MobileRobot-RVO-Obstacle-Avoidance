# MobileRobot-RVO-Obstacle-Avoidance
This repo relate to implementing c++ code of obstacle avoidance algorithm name Reciprocal Velocity Obstacle on Gazebo simulator and ROS1. 
We used at least two turtlebot3 burger models as our robots.
[] Frist step is designing Custome Close area in gazebo. This model is in "multi-agents/gazebomodels/CloseArea1"
